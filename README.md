# Meet Halfway

Lauren Dyson, Christine Chung, Paul Mack, Leith Mcindewar

## Goal
Meet Halfway helps Chicagoans find a place to meet that requires roughly equal travel times for both parties given two starting destinations, preferred modes of transit, and desired type of location (coffee shop, restaurant, park etc.).
